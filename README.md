# React Native Type Mismatch Error with Third-Party Library

This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky bug in React Native development involving type mismatches when integrating third-party libraries.  The bug arises from inconsistencies between the expected event structure or data format of the library and the actual data provided by React Native.

## Bug Description

A type mismatch error occurs when a third-party library anticipates specific properties or data types in events or data structures, but the data received from React Native deviates from these expectations. This often manifests as unexpected behavior, crashes, or silent failures.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run the app. Observe the error messages in the console.

## Solution
The solution involves careful inspection and potential adaptation of the data structure received from React Native to match the third-party library's requirements. This might include restructuring, mapping, filtering, or using a data adapter layer.
